Opening

NARRATOR: Somewhere deep within uncharted space...

GUY: Er... Solarwind, are you sure we're headed in the right direction? I'm feeling uneasy... or hungry. I can't really tell which.

SOLARWIND: Yes, Captain. Navigational systems suggest we should reach Sithtarra within the day.

GUY: Of course we will! I was merely testing you, Solarwind. As always, you've passed with flying colors.

SOLARWIND: -sigh- Thank you, Captain.

GUY: I'm going to catch a few winks in the meantime, wake me if there's anything I need to—

NARRATOR: Just at that moment, the intrepid Captain Guy and his trusty spaceship/girlfriend Solarwind are caught within a vicious tractor beam!

SOLARWIND: Captain, we're caught within a vicious tractor beam!

GUY: Damn it all! There goes our dinner plans...

SOLARWIND: I think you should see this, Captain...

GUY: See what, Solarw—oh. My. God.

NARRATOR: As our handsome hero looks out from the cockpit, he sees a massive manmade planet staring at him with a gaping black maw! Suddenly, an alien voice breaks over the ship's intercom.

ZETAN VOICE: Spacecraft unidentified. You are now trespassing in Zetan space. All lifeforms aboard are subject to investigation. Prepare to dock. Welcome to Zeta Prime.

NARRATOR: As Captain Guy and Solarwind are swallowed up by this monstrosity, hundreds of the hideous Zetans surround them.

ZETAN 1: Step away from the ship. You will forfeit all arms. You will come with us to be incarcerated. You will cooperate, or you will die.

NARRATOR: With little choice, Captain Guy climbs down from the cockpit and hands over his beloved blaster. 

SOLARWIND: Captain, nooooooo!

GUY: Don't worry, Solarwind. I can deal with these... things. I'll be back for you. I promise!
